# Learning personality from Social Media
Based on the results from [this paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/12714v) and using the well vetted OCEAN psychological personality profile, we attempted to build a model to try to intuit an arbitrary user's personality type based only on their social media activity and the activity of other people with known scores. 

The results are rather abstract, since doing an actual test on real people would be more difficult to facilitate, but our model does seem to be able to fairly accurately predict the personality. This can improve the effectiveness of social media advertisement.
